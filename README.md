# Jelly Bean CSS Art

This project showcases a simple yet delightful piece of art created purely with HTML and CSS: a colorful and glossy jelly bean that appears to float gently. This CSS art piece is a great example of how basic shapes and gradients can be used to create visually appealing designs with depth and animation.

## Overview

The Jelly Bean CSS Art is designed to demonstrate the power of CSS properties, including `border-radius`, gradients (`radial-gradient`), and simple keyframe animations. It's a fun and engaging way to practice CSS skills, focusing on creating shapes and adding lifelike characteristics such as glossiness and movement.

## Features

- **Shape and Color**: The jelly bean has a classic, elongated shape with a vibrant color that can be easily customized.
- **Gloss Effect**: A subtle shine effect is achieved through the use of a radial gradient, giving the jelly bean a glossy, realistic look.
- **Floating Animation**: A gentle floating effect is created with a simple CSS animation, adding dynamism to the art piece.

## How It's Made

### The HTML Structure

The HTML structure is straightforward, consisting of a `div` container for the jelly bean and another `div` inside it for the shine effect.

```html
<div class="jellybean">
    <div class="shine"></div>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling

The jelly bean and its shine are styled using CSS. The key aspects include the use of `border-radius` to create the rounded shape of the jelly bean and the jelly bean's shine. A `radial-gradient` is used for the shine to mimic light reflecting off a glossy surface. The entire jelly bean is animated to float gently using `@keyframes`.

## Conclusion

This Jelly Bean CSS Art project is a playful way to explore CSS capabilities. It serves as a reminder that with creativity and a deep understanding of CSS properties, you can bring almost any idea to life in the browser without the need for images or complex JavaScript.
